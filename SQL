*/Question: The above chart shows the number of engaged users each week. Yammer defines engagement as having made some type of server call by interacting with the product (shown in the data as events of type “engagement”). Any point in this chart can be interpreted as “the number of users who logged at least one engagement event during the week starting on that date.”

You are responsible for determining what caused the dip at the end of the chart shown above and, if appropriate, recommending solutions for the problem.*/

--Hypothesis 1: Decline in User Growth
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', e.created_at), 
      COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as all_users, 
      COUNT(CASE WHEN e.activated_at IS NOT NULL THEN e.user_id ELSE NULL END) as new_users

--Hypothesis 2: Decline in Particular Engagement
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), event_name, DATE_TRUNC('week', occurred_at)

--Hypothesis 3: Increase in user count after email campaign
